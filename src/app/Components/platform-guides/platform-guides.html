<h1>How It Works: Build Your Custom Website in 4 Steps</h1>
<br>
<br>
<h2>At Click Site, we turn the complex process of writing technical prompts into a simple selection of components. Our system connects all the technical puzzle pieces into one perfect instruction to build your digital asset.</h2>
<br>

<p>
<b>1. Define Your Project (No Limits)</b>
<br>
The first step is choosing the purpose of your website. Our system supports any type of website you can imagine—from complex e-commerce stores and blogs to CMS systems, professional portals, landing pages, or unique service platforms. You define the vision; we provide the framework.
<br>
<br>
<b>2. Assemble Components from the Catalog (Prompt Concatenation)</b>
<br>
This is where you design your site’s functionality by selecting "products" (components):
Built-in Interfaces: Define the Admin platform, User Interface areas, and page structures.
Element Selection: Choose menus, filters, and technical tools from our verified database. Every component you select is automatically concatenated into a stable, reliable technical prompt that we have tested and verified.
<br>
<br>
<b>3. Personalize with Free Text (AI Processing)</b>
<br>
If you have a unique idea or a function that doesn’t exist in our catalog, you can add it via free text. To maintain a high standard of performance, our system sends your request to Gemini for processing. The AI reformulates your requirement into an optimal technical format that merges seamlessly with the rest of the prompt.
<br>
<br>
<b>4. Receive the Final Prompt</b>
<br>
Once you finish assembling your components and complete the purchase, the system generates your complete "recipe." This is a professionally concatenated prompt, ready to be copied and pasted directly into building platforms (like Bolt or Base44), turning your specifications into a live website within minutes.
